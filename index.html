    <div id="tribute-info"><li>1964 – Jennifer Doudna was born in Washington, D.C.</li><br><br>
      <li>1971 – When she was 7 years old, Jennifer's father accepted a position with the Department of Defense in Hawaii, so that is where they moved.</li><br><br>
      <li>1972-1974 - She was ostracized for the next several years in school since she was a young blond girl that did not fit among the Polynesians. Her father saw her as a kindred spirit and left a copy of the book, The Double Helix on her bed when she was in sixth grade. The book is about the shape and structure of a chemical molecule (DNA) and the biological role it can play. Doudna’s career would be shaped by the insight at the core of this book by James Watson.</li><br><br>
      <li>1981-1984 – Jennifer started at Pomona College, in California, at the age 17. The first year was tough on her, and by the Fall on the next year she made friends and became more confident.  In her Junior year, she got a job in the lab of her advisor, and with those challenges, she became a role model for rother women. Her advisor warned her that a technician had been working on a certain bacteria project for quite some time and was unable to make it work. She was ambitious and took risks to try new methods that had positive results. She was rewarded with her name appearing in a scientific journal.</li><br><br>
      <li>1985 – During the summer she landed a job in the lab of the head of graduate studies at Harvard, where she would start her studies in the Fall. She was responsible for cloning genes from bacteria in order to determine how bacteria make molecules that are toxic to other molecules. She had a novel way to set up the process, but was told it would not work. Doudna was stubborn and continued with her idea. “I did it my way and got the clone,” she told her superior.</li><br><br>
      <li>1986 - Jennifer found that yeast cells were very efficient at taking up pieces of DNA, so she used that as her experiment for her dissertation. With strands of DNA that she engineered that ended up with a sequence that matched a sequence in the yeast, she gave it a little shock, opened up passageways in the cell walls of the yeast, allowing the DNA to wriggle inside. With the recombination of the yeast’s DNA, she had made atoll that could edit the genes of yeast.</li><br><br>
