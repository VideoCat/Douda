      <li>1964 – Jennifer Doudna was born in Washington, D.C.</li><br><br>
      <li>1971 – When she was 7 years old, Jennifer's father accepted a position with the Department of Defense in Hawaii, so that is where they moved.</li><br><br>
      <li>1972-1974 - She was ostracized for the next several years in school since she was a young blond girl that did not fit among the Polynesians. Her father saw her as a kindred spirit and left a copy of the book, <i>The Double Helix</i> on her bed when she was in sixth grade. The book is about the shape and structure of a chemical molecule (DNA) and the biological role it can play. Doudna’s career would be shaped by the insight at the core of this book by James Watson.</li><br><br>
      <li>1981-1984 – Jennifer started at Pomona College in California at the age 17. The first year was tough on her, and by the Fall of the next year she made friends and became more confident.  In her Junior year, she got a job in the lab of her advisor, and with those challenges, she became a role model for other women. Her advisor warned her that a technician had been working on a certain bacteria project for quite some time and was unable to make it work. She was ambitious and took risks to try new methods that had positive results for this project. She was rewarded with her name appearing in a scientific journal.</li><br><br>
      <li>1985 – After graduating from Pomona College, during the summer, she landed a job in the lab of the head of graduate studies at Harvard, where she would start her studies in the Fall. She was responsible for cloning genes from bacteria in order to determine how bacteria made molecules that are toxic to other bacteria. She had a novel way to set up the process, but was told it would not work. Doudna was stubborn and continued with her idea. “I did it my way and got the clone,” she told her superior.</li><br><br>
      <li>1986 - Jennifer found that yeast cells were very efficient at taking up pieces of DNA, so she used that as her experiment for her dissertation. With strands of DNA that she engineered that ended up with a sequence that matched a sequence in the yeast, she gave it a little shock, so it opened up passageways in the cell walls of the yeast, allowing the DNA to wriggle inside. With the recombination of the yeast’s DNA, she had made a tool that could edit the genes of yeast.</li><br><br>
      <li>1989 - Jennifer earned her Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School</li><br><br>
      <li>2002 - Jennifer accepted a faculty position at UC, Berkeley as a professor of Biochemistry and Moleculer Biology.</li><br><br>
      <li>2012 - Jennifer Doudna, along with Emmanuelle Charpentier, proposed using CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) as a method to cut and edit genes in the RNA of cells.</li><br><br>
      <li>2020 - Jennifer put a team together to start using the CRISPR method to test for the presence of COVID-19 in the samples taken from human patients. Next, she used CRISPR as a method to develop an RNA-based vaccine for COVID-19. She was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Emmanuelle Charpentier.</li><br><br><br>
